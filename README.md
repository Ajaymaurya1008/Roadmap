#Roadmap for FrontEnd

W3 schools is the website I used to learn most of the things 
https://www.w3schools.com/

I started with HTML ofcourse, build pages learn properties
And then I learnt CSS to style webpages
Flex and grid are two of the most important topics, you need to master them for sure
Now, Try to build static pages like login signup and landing page
Then Learn about responsive designing and media queries
For CSS, the best person on internet is Kevin Powell

Also, I learnt a lot of things from Anuj Bhaiya Web Development playlist

Then you can finally jump on to JS.
It will give life to your website and you have to give the maximum amount of your time in leaning this because there's no end to it
You can learn JS from bootcamps or detailed course as per your choice
